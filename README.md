# Weather Alert Site

This is the client site that displays the data collected by the [NWWS Server](https://github.com/TheRangiCrew/NWWS-Server). All data is stored in a [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) project and is displayed in real-time.

The site uses [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) with TypeScript to server render client components. Styling is created using [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss).
